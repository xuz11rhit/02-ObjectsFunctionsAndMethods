# DONE: 2.
#   Allow this module to use the  rosegraphics.py  module by marking the
#     src
#   folder in this project as a "Sources Root", as follows:
#
#     In the Project window (to the left), right click on the src  folder,
#     then select  Mark Directory As  ~  Sources Root.

# DONE: 5.
#   COMMIT-and-PUSH your work (after changing this TO-DO to DONE).
#
#   As a reminder, here is how you should do so:
#     1. Select   VCS   from the menu bar (above).
#     2. Choose  Commit  from the pull-down menu that appears.
#     3. In the  Commit Changes  window that pops up,
#        press the   Commit and Push   button.
#           Note: If you see only a Commit button:
#              - HOVER over the  Commit  button
#                  (in the lower-right corner of the window)
#              - CLICK on  Commit and Push.
#
#   COMMIT adds the changed work to the version control on your computer.
#   PUSH adds the changed work into your Github repository in the "cloud".
#
#   COMMIT-and-PUSH your work as often as you want, but at the least, commit
#   and push after you have tested a module and believe that it is correct.
